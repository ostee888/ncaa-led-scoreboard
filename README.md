# Ncaa-Led-Scoreboard

# Description
This project is in the VERY early versions and is not close to a final release. The goal of this project is to make modifying parameters, locations of text, location of logos, integrating goal events with other projects, and other things easy for the end user. I also have not seen an NCAA Hockey scoreboard before, so this project began because of that.

# Updates
I am currently in university so I do not have a lot of time to work on this project. I will work on it and release small updates as I complete them.
